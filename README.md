# SolidWorksSampleCode
There will be some sample code to deveop for SolidWorks addin
This is the first project I shared on GitHub, which is to generate some PNG files using SolidWorks interop application on a .SLDPRT file, and further to generate a GIF.
Just have the code here. To let it build, please create a console C# application and add reference to SolidWorks interop assemblies, and then build.
